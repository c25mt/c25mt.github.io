	<h1>My Journal</h1>

	<h2>10/6/2021</h2>
		<p>Today I worked on my journal and I made sure that the links worked on my homepage. I also am working on the homepage and trying to match it to my original album cover design.</p>

	<h2>10/8/2021</h2>
		<p>Today I made the background black and I made sure that the links work.</p>

	<h2>10/18/2021</h2>
		<p>Today Molly helped me with the positioning of the covers and I added labels to the pictures. I also did a lot of customization to the journal today.</p>

	<h2>10/20/2021</h2>
		<p>I made the animation more complex by adding to the pictures, making it multiple instead of one that show up after the portal. It took a really long time to make the animation how I wanted.</p>
